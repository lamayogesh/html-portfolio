<h1>The Best Movies and Series According to Yogesh watched in 2023</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies or Series of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>

<p>This movie is easily going on my top 10 favorites of all time list. I absolutely love the concept of the
    multiverse, and all the different versions and ideas of it that people have, so I may be tad biased,
    but this movis is genuinely near perfection in every way. There are so many places where
    everything could have gone completely wrong and ruined the whole film had it been done differently,
    but that didn't happen. It manages to be so freaking chaotic and all over the place throughout its
    entire runtime, while somehow being completely down to the earth and sensible enough that I feel
    that anyone could understand and follow how everything worked and what was happening, and not
    be bored or overwhelmed.

<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>

<p>Breaking Bad was an amazing show. Once you start watching Breaking Bad Season 1, it will
    feel a bit slow but gradually as the story progresses, it becomes strongly addictive and gets very
    interesting. Everything was perfect about this show in my opinion. The acting was perfect, the
    storyline and script of the show was very good; the way everything takes places and how the plot
    suddenly thickens ehan something significant happens is certainly very good. The plot twists were
    very surprising and interesting.

<h3>The Wold of Wall Street</h3>

<p>I would like to give this movie 4.5 out of 5 stars. The movie isn't generic biopic of
    prominent, respectable person but is based on true story on a stockbrocker named Jordan Belfort. It's
    a rollercoaster ride which takes Jordan from nobody to rich man. This movie was quite inspiring
    and I absolutely enjoyed Belforts charecter.
